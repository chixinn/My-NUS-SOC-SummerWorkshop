## Group Project

Self-propose an interesting analytics problem that requires some form of predictive analytics using web data.

# Intro to Analytics

New Start-ups cold start: we don't have data => buy data.

Data is key ingredient for making all these things happen.

## Decision making

How to?

Make predictions on historical data, generate models and make prediction of future data instances.

## Decision model

Software/mathematical formula

## Types of decision problem

- Regression : Stock price prediction
- Classification: Weather forecast
- Clustering: Group Weibo/Twitter user based on their interest.

### Regression v.s.Classification

(Supervised)Regression: The **prediction**  is **continuous.**

(Supervised)Classification: The **prediction**  is **discrete.**

(Supervised) Teach the  PCs the pattern.

Why identifier?

All unique and no patterns 

## Regression

1. 用excel就可以做回归

### Perform regression in WEKA

WEKA 对标SPSS!

[WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

## Statistical learning

$y_i=f(x_i)+\epsilon_i$

### Why we estimate `f`here

1. Prediction
2. Inference

## Inference

例子里面7个特征，但只有5个被选了。

所以Model f还可以帮我find realtionship

## Unsupervised learning 

没有y就相当于supervised learning里面的test-dataSet(X values)

Motivations/Why unsupervised is important/It is very tedious to find examples. Find y-values for large collections of examples.

Supervised learning 人工打标签很累哦。

Unsupervised is not good enough, but important.

We first use unsupervised learning method to get our data labeled and then apply supervised learning model to get a more specific model.

Unsupervised learning: Exploratory and analysis .Get a sense of the data. Iris data 的感知sense;Data ideal  ;DL takes up lot of time.

或者在情感分析，分类之前先知道我们需要几类。

Annette  the data.
