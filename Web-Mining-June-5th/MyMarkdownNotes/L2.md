# L2：Cross-Industry Standard Process For Data Mining

## Outline

- Intro to Data Mining
- CRISP-DM
- Intro to Web Mining

## Data Ming

- Data is stored in digital form(Data Bases) ; Challenge: Turn hard copy into digital ones.
- Raw Data  ->  Try to Look For Patterns  -> Knowledge

### Huge Web Data

We are very reliable on Internet.

### What is Big Data?

Big data: Huge amount of Data

5V of Big Data: Volume/Velocity/Value/Veracity/Variety

### Why Big data?

从哪来的这么多数据：

Automatically collect data: Public available datasets/API

Data downloaded from Kaggle is very specific and academic. So we need to mine Web Data.

### Big Data analytics

Data without analysis is simply noise.

Big Data+ Big analytics=Values

## CRISP-DM--Methodolgy

### Step1 Business understanding(Problem Understanding )

- Project objectives prediction stock prices: regression这种
- Requirements of the business/problem

> 【重要】Process是从理解问题开始的，不是start with Data!
>
> When stepping out of school:模型多复杂没用，what I can do for the company 最重要【PS】
>
> Objective is not come up with beautiful videos. The  problem is how to get more people to use it .Having beautiful videos are encouraging more people to use it.

#### Propose some analytics initiatives where Taobao/Amazon will benefit from（Interactive）

Data analytics project 

- Suppose the initiative is generate more sales, what is the modeling problem?

左边是分类问题,X是什么？discount? What is the best discount.

右边是回归，what will the sales be like?

How to give relevant recommendation?

#### Suppose the model is regression

可能是多个modeling problem的组成？

1. Good review or not (Rating/Comments)
2. Others.

#### Whole ideas behind

**How to create values for company.**

They don't bother much algorithms, they care about the profit.再好的model，也要有适合该model的上下文。

> Analytics is not about just modeling and DeepLearning.

### Step2 - Data Understanding

Learn how to mine the datasets yourself.

- Exploratory Data Analysis(Figure out what the data is telling you.)

  Unsupervised learning也干了这事【233因为上节课问问题这节课被cue了

  - Perform statistical analysis
  - Perform various types of visualizations.

#### Hands on EDA--Giving you a sense of Data

嘤嘤，这个`shift+Tab` Mac也用不了呀

注意名字这里多一个空格，神奇。

how to get the mean for the GRE score?

`data["GRE Score"].mean()`;`data["GRE Score"].std()`

- Correlations:May be the data is incorrect. Whether the data is making sense logically.

#### Why we do regression analysis since we 've already have correlation ship.

**Rationale**: If we are not able to observe any patterns in the data, it might not be meaningful to continue with the predictive modeling. Conversely if we are able to see any obvious patterns in the data, it can allow us to confirm our intuition on how the data is supposed to be.

> Links all variables. Combine everything together as a single model. Correlation only tells us about one pair of variables.

即使是正相关，但是在线性回归里系数也可能有负数。

>  EDA:Better appreciate the data without looking at the numbers

#### Q4

![Screen Shot 2021-06-05 at 14.35.44](/Users/chixinning/Desktop/My-NUS-SOC-SummerWorkshop/Web-Mining-June-5th/MyMarkdownNotes/L2.assets/Screen Shot 2021-06-05 at 14.35.44.png)

从这个直方图可视化我们可以看图说话得到什么？

这俩是clearly different distribution，但still conform to our common sense.

#### Conclusion 

明确data和我们的sense相一致。

### Step3 DataCleaning

**Several techniques for handling incomplete data:** 

**Elimination**

- Discard all records with one or more missing attributes
- Remove the attribute with missing values
- **However, elimination will lead to smaller dataset which may affect the model performance**【PS】 kaggle里面也是这么讲的。

#### Detecting outliers

1. 正态分布的分位数
2. Boxplot

2 dot: 2 outlier

IQR: inside quartile range:Q3-Q1

#### Data integration

**Data Wrangling** **is the process of performing data transformation**

• Basic data manipulation operations: 

• Selecting of rows/columns

• Filtering by conditions

• Merge datasets together

• Grouping columns 

### Step4 Modeling

• Regression
 • Classification
 • Clustering
 • Association Rules • Neural Networks • Deep Learning
 • etc

#### Association rules

> Super market problem: how to place the products?

> How to determine 2 things are similar . Buy this buy another

### Step5 Evaluation

- Regression: MSE(均方误差)
- Classification:Accuracy
- 但是Information Retrieval 中看中的是Precision and Recall.
